    "# Social Network Ads Dataset: High-Level Plan for Data Loading and Analysis\n",
    "### Team: The p < 0.05 Team - Haig Bedros, Noori Selina, Julia Ferris, Matthew Roland\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "To make a plan for loading and analyzing a social network dataset to predict user buying behavior based on centrality measures and comparing different categorical groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Source\n",
    "The dataset is a CSV file from Kaggle containing social network ads data, which includes user details and whether they purchased a product.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "- **URL**: [Social Network Ads Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakeshrau/social-network-ads/data)\n",
    "- **Columns**: \n",
    "  - User ID\n",
    "  - Gender\n",
    "  - Age\n",
    "  - EstimatedSalary\n",
    "  - Purchased\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Loading\n",
    "- **Install Necessary Libraries**: We will be using `pandas`, `networkx`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.\n",
    "- **Load the Dataset**: Use `pandas` to load the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing\n",
    "- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:\n",
    "  - Explore the data structure and types.\n",
    "  - Handle any missing values.\n",
    "  - Visualize the distribution of key variables.\n",
    "- **Handling Categorical Data**: Convert categorical variables like Gender to numbers for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Network Construction\n",
    "- **Create a Social Network Graph**:\n",
    "  - Use `networkx` to create a graph where nodes represent users and edges represent hypothetical interactions (based on similar age and estimated salary).\n",
    "  - Add nodes with attributes from the dataset.\n",
    "  - Define criteria for creating edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Centrality Measures\n",
    "- **Calculate Degree and Eigenvector Centrality**:\n",
    "  - Use `networkx` to calculate degree centrality of each node (user).\n",
    "  - Implement Google's PageRank algorithm for eigenvector centrality to handle potential convergence issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Visualization and Analysis\n",
    "- **Visualization**:\n",
    "  - Visualize degree distribution of the nodes.\n",
    "  - Identify top users based on degree centrality.\n",
    "  - Calculate and visualize the minimum, average, and range of degrees.\n",
    "- **Snowball Sampling**:\n",
    "  - Apply snowball sampling to create a smaller subset of the network.\n",
    "- **Trimming the Network**:\n",
    "  - Continuously trim the network to ensure a manageable size for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothetical Outcome\n",
    "By comparing degree centrality across categorical groups, we might discover that users with higher centrality (more connections) are more likely to purchase products. This insight can help target marketing efforts towards highly connected individuals who may influence their network. For example, if females aged 25-35 with high degree centrality show higher purchase rates, marketing strategies could focus on engaging these influential users to drive product adoption within their social circles."
