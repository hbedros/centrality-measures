    "# Social Network Ads Dataset: High-Level Plan for Data Loading and Analysis\n",
    "### Team: The p < 0.05 Team\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "To make a plan for loading and analyzing a social network dataset to predict user buying behavior based on centrality measures and comparing different categorical groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Source\n",
    "The dataset is a CSV file from Kaggle containing social network ads data, which includes user details and whether they purchased a product.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "- **URL**: [Social Network Ads Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakeshrau/social-network-ads/data)\n",
    "- **Columns**: \n",
    "  - User ID\n",
    "  - Gender\n",
    "  - Age\n",
    "  - EstimatedSalary\n",
    "  - Purchased\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Loading\n",
    "- **Install Necessary Libraries**: We will be using `pandas` and `networkx`.\n",
    "- **Load the Dataset**: `pandas` to load the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing\n",
    "- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:\n",
    "  - Exploring the data structure and types.\n",
    "  - Handling missing values.\n",
    "  - Visualizing the distribution of key variables.\n",
    "- **Handling Categorical Data**: We will have to convert categorical variables like Gender to numbers for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Network Construction\n",
    "- **Create a Social Network Graph**:\n",
    "  - We will use `networkx` to create a graph where nodes represent users and edges represent hypothetical interactions (like users with similar attributes).\n",
    "  - Add nodes with attributes from the dataset.\n",
    "  - Define criteria for creating edges (like users of the same age and gender).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Centrality Measures\n",
    "- **Calculate Degree Centrality**:\n",
    "  - We will use `networkx` to calculate the degree centrality of each node (user).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Analysis and Prediction\n",
    "- **Compare Centrality Across Categorical Groups**:\n",
    "  - We can visualize centrality measures by groups like gender or purchasing behavior.\n",
    "- **Predictive Modeling**:\n",
    "  - We can use centrality measures and other features to predict purchasing behavior.\n",
    "  - We can also train a machine learning model to classify users as purchasers or non-purchasers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothetical Outcome\n",
    "By comparing degree centrality across categorical groups, we might discover that users with higher centrality (more connections) are more likely to purchase products. This insight can help target marketing efforts towards highly connected individuals who may influence their network. For example, if females aged 25-35 with high degree centrality show higher purchase rates, marketing strategies could focus on engaging these influential users to drive product adoption within their social circles."
